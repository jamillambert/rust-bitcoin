# Rust Bitcoin - network types

This crate provides Bitcoin network identifiers and helpers that are shared
across the `rust-bitcoin` stack. Unless you are building a very small binary,
you should use these types via the `bitcoin` crate instead of depending on this
crate directly.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This library should compile with any combination of features on **Rust 1.74.0**.
